these genetic polymorphisms are not contributing to the neuromotor and @DISEASE$ observed in @GENE$.,False,True
"As SNPs in @GENE$ increase risk for both @DISEASE$ and multiple sclerosis, this suggests a common pathway in the pathogenesis of these diseases.",False,False

The study did not show that the C242T polymorphism of the @GENE$ gene is a risk factor of @DISEASE$ in children.,False,True
the present findings did not support the hypothesis of an effect of the T3111C @GENE$ variant on @DISEASE$ in major depressive disorder.,False,False
Our result showed no association between the C-180G SNP and the serum @GENE$ concentrations and suggests that the high resistin level in @DISEASE$ patients may play an important role in colon cancer development.,False,False
the Trp(64)Arg @DISEASE$ of @GENE$ has little or no influence on either body weight or body mass index in the general Japanese population.,False,False
